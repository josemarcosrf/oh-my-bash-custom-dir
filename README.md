# Oh-my-bash custom dir backup

This repo contains my [oh-my-bash](https://ohmybash.github.io/) ([src](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash)) custom directory backup.

Mainly:

 - All definitions that before were in `.bashrc` 
 - A bunch of custom themes (those starting by `jmrf`). Some changes to the colors and the `$PS1`, the shell prompt of these themes.
 - A collection of useful [bash_functions](bash_functions.sh)


## Restore

To restore, simply copy the entire repo in the `custom` sub-folder of the `oh-my-bash` installation directory. (i.e.: `~/.oh-my-bash/custom`)
